Algorithmic trading
Algorithmic Trading is the use of algorithms in the financial market to make trading decisions. JP Morgan Chase & Co. is one of the businesses that use Algorithmic Trading for investment decisions.

Algorithmic Trading means using algorithms in buying and selling decisions in the financial market. In an algorithmic trading strategy, a set of predefined rules are used to determine when to buy a financial instrument and when to sell it.

In simple words, Algorithmic Trading is a way of buying and selling automatically and efficiently, which is always better than trading manually.
